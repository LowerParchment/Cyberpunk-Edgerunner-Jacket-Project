# Cyberpunk-Edgerunner-Jacket-Project

The goal of this project is to take a basic cyberpunk cosplay jacket from Amazon, and add a fully functional LED light array to the collar to allow for microphone reactivity, or standard animations coded by the user.

The main hardware used for this project is a Arduino Uno, a sound sensor, a push button to switch "profiles", and a power bank with a switch to power it all. If you want an more in-depth look, refer to the wiring diagram on the main code hub.
